# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run electron:serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Automatically opens a window when loaded.\

Alternatively open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run electron:build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\

To run the production ready version look in the `dist` folder and run the setup exe.
